<summary> <b> My Childhood</b> </summary>
<p> 
I grew up in Hyderabad which is one of the famous metropolitan cities located in the South India. Hyderabad is famous for its unique style of making Briyani. Many places are worth visiting like the charminar,Golkonda fort,Cyber Towers,Choumahalla palace,Nizam Museum etc. My house was located near Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. I often visited the stadium and watch cricket matches. Everyday morning i used to get up and go for a jog until the stadium and get some fresh air. I really miss those days!
